    "text": "hoyeon.cho@gmail.com\n\n\n au.linkedin.com/in/owen-hoyeon-cho-910b0115\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwen Cho is a data scientist with a background in corporate strategy. He now leads the data education startup, DeepSkill. After earning his MBA from the University of Cambridge, Owen further specialised as a senior data scientist in Health Policy Analysis, conducting numerous public health data projects, including health utilisation forecasts. He emphasises the importance of balancing hard skills with soft skills for data-driven problem solving in an age flourishing with ever-evolving tools.\n\nBackground\nThe English National Health Service (NHS) has endeavoured to ensure universal healthcare, aiming to provide equal access to all based on clinical needs rather than financial capabilities. However, achieving this ideal has been challenging, with socio-demographic factors often influencing health outcomes and access to care. Recognising the importance of communicating these disparities to a wider audience, a data visualisation competition was initiated.\nIn the competition, my interactive data visualisation titled “What If”, which employed the “scrollytelling” technique, was honoured to receive the Gold Award for Dynamic Visualisation. The insights I gained from studying the universal healthcare system played a pivotal role in shaping my approach and understanding of the issue.\n\n\nApproach\nTo bring the issue of health inequality to life, I crafted a narrative centred around two fictional characters, Ajay and Bob. Both faced similar health challenges, but their socio-economic backgrounds set them on divergent paths. Bob, based in a deprived area, unfortunately, couldn’t survive his condition, while Ajay managed to overcome his.\nUsing a storytelling approach inspired by the film Irreversible, I retraced their journeys in reverse. This method allowed for a poignant exploration of the cascading effects of socio-economic factors on health outcomes. Through a series of thought-provoking “What if” scenarios, the narrative delved deeper into the systemic issues:\n\nSecondary care What if Bob had been able to access timely and appropriate secondary care?\nPrimary care What if Bob had visited his GP more frequently, allowing for earlier detection and prevention of his condition?\nInfrastructure What if Bob had lived in a better-quality, warmer home during his childhood?\nLifestyle What if Bob had maintained a healthier lifestyle and wasn’t obese?\nEducation What if Bob had received a better education, improving his employment opportunities and overall lifestyle?\n\nTo lend a more analytical dimension to the story, I integrated a machine learning model. Drawing from my academic learnings gained from the Health Data Science course, this model quantified the influence of each socio-economic factor on health outcomes using SHAP values.\n\n\n\nA snapshot of images from What if?, which uses dynamic visualisations to reveal a compelling narrative about health inequality. View the full interactive story at healthpolicy.github.io/nhs_whatif\n\n\n\n\nData Source\nVarious data sources from relevant institutions were the pivotal starting point of the project. GOV.UK was instrumental in providing the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) metrics and crucial education statistics, encompassing data on pupil disadvantage and Level 3 attainment by age 19. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) furnished invaluable population estimates and insights on Gross Disposable Household Income. From the NHS, I obtained data shedding light on coronary heart disease mortality and the consequential years of life lost. LG Inform was a valuable resource, offering CHD admission data and insights on prevalent healthy eating habits. Lastly, Public Health England enriched the dataset with information on obesity prevalence, alcohol-related admissions, asthma hospitalizations, and cardiovascular disease mortality rates. All these data points were accessed in February 2020.\n\n\nData Visualisation Technique\nMy approach to data visualisation was a blend of academic knowledge and insights from the Masters course. Taking a cue from Edward Tufte’s emphasis on seamless transitions, I ensured that the visual narrative flowed effortlessly. For instance, the depiction of England’s regions on a map evolved into a chart, illustrating the transformation of geographical divisions into stark health disparities.\nFurthermore, I incorporated the brushing technique in data visualisation. This interactive tool allows users to select specific data subsets and highlight them across various visualisations. It’s an effective way to unearth patterns and trends that might be obscured at first glance, offering viewers a more detailed insight on demand.\nThe significant tool was D3.js, a JavaScript library that enables intricate data visualizations. To seamlessly integrate D3.js visualizations into my project, I utilised the r2d3 package, which facilitated the knitting of D3.js scripts into RMarkdown. This combination ensured that the visualizations were not only interactive but also deeply integrated with the narrative.\nIn wrapping up, this endeavour was more than just an academic exercise; it was a passionate attempt to shed light on the pressing issue of health inequalities. While the recognition was gratifying, the ultimate goal remains: advocating for a more equitable health system for all. In retrospect, this was a great chance to utilise learnings from the Masters program."

Liam is researching the relationship between computer mouse activity and mental health status using machine learning. Elisabeth is working with the Centre for Big Data Research in Health to better understand barriers and facilitators of the implementation of AI systems in general practice.\n\nWhy Choose Clinical AI?\nEarly last year we were presented with a unique opportunity for our honours year—a coursework-intensive honours stream focused on clinical AI. As we selected the stream during its inaugural year, we weren’t sure what to expect, but the prospect of becoming data science-literate medical students was convincing enough! Many of our peers have long held a passion for data science or an unexplored ambition to establish a healthcare AI startup and similarly jumped at this exciting opportunity.\nArtificial intelligence has been the headline news story of 2023. AI discovered a new antibiotic, Halicin, in 2019, and is already being used in imaging analysis and clinical decision-making. AI offers limitless opportunities to enhance patient outcomes by facilitating a more personalised approach to medical care, decreasing human errors, improving the accuracy and speed of diagnosis, reducing healthcare costs and increasing doctor-patient engagement. As expected with any major technological shift, this excitement has been accompanied with growing uncertainty surrounding what the role of a doctor will look like in the future. Ultimately, technology in medicine is here to stay, and while change in medical practice is inevitable, we think that the impending digital revolution in healthcare offers immense opportunities to healthcare workers and is a cause for excitement rather than pessimism. Doctors will be integral in identifying areas in the healthcare system that can be optimised by technology, and applying and interpreting new technology will become central to the role of medical practitioners.\nWe see the clinical AI program as an invaluable introduction to this unfolding healthcare transformation and as a fantastic opportunity to understand how medicine and AI will intersect. We aim to not only leverage the power of data science to enhance patient care, but also to contribute to the advancement of medical research and healthcare systems as a whole. This immersive experience allows us to gain a deep understanding of the applications and limitations of AI in the clinical setting, and how it can be harnessed to transform healthcare delivery. The coursework offers us a taste of the necessary skills needed to navigate the emerging landscape of AI in healthcare.\n\n\n\nStructure of the Clinical AI program and what we have learned\nAlongside our independent research projects, the Clinical AI coursework consists of two courses in each of Terms 1 and 2, taken from the Masters of Health Data Science program. In Term 1, there were four contact hours per week, with a large part of the learning conducted through self-directed modules and activities.\nIn HDAT9100, we explored the intricacies of data creation in the health system and its utilisation in analysis and research. We learned to think critically about the limitations and biases associated with different mediums of health data and explored creative methods to overcome these challenges. We also looked at how health outcomes could be measured and analysed to identify areas of inequality and create evidence for policy. Understanding the nuances of healthcare data helped us to better understand the structure of the public and private health systems and complemented our clinical experience.\nHDAT9300 provided our first formal education in computer programming in the Python language, which was particularly exciting. The course emphasised the importance of code that not only functions correctly, but is also written efficiently and clearly. The assignments in this course were especially engaging as they were themed around health-related problems, such as calculating kidney function, evaluating DNA sequences and analysing patient datasets. This highlighted the broad applications of software in medicine and prompted us to consider the role technology can play in creating scalable healthcare solutions. The course provided a strong introduction to the fundamentals of programming for us to build on in further courses and in our research.\nWith these strong foundations, we look forward to taking on AI itself in Term 2 and applying this knowledge to our research. HDAT9500 will introduce us to machine learning and data mining, while HDAT9000 will explore the opportunities and boundaries associated with applying AI to healthcare, as well as the complicated ethical, social and legal issues that arise in this space.\n\n\nWhat We Have Enjoyed About Clinical AI\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of the Clinical AI program has been the opportunity to expand our problem-solving abilities through coding. The assignments and projects have encouraged us to think analytically and creatively, applying our programming knowledge to health-related problems. This practical approach has sparked our curiosity about the broad applications of software in medicine and equipped us with the fundamental technical abilities necessary to tackle real-world healthcare challenges.\nThe flexibility of the program has also stood out. While there are structured contact hours every week, a significant portion of the learning is independent study that can be completed on your own time. This flexibility has provided us with a lot of freedom in choosing our research project and allowed us to explore topics of personal interest within the realm of clinical AI.\nCollaboration has been a central part of the clinical AI journey and has greatly enhanced our experience. The coursework fosters a supportive learning environment through team-based projects and group discussions. This reflects the reality of the healthcare setting, where teamwork is essential for achieving stronger outcomes.\n\n\nChallenges\nOne of the main challenges we have encountered during the Clinical AI program is finding a balance between our research projects, which have longer-term deadlines, with the more immediate demands of the coursework. Weekly assignments alleviate the stress of end-of-term exams but require a consistent and organised approach to coursework that must be maintained.\nTaking on the challenge of the coursework-intensive Clinical AI honours program has been well worth it. It’s been satisfying to see our knowledge and skills grow substantially in just one term and we are looking forward to what this new term has to offer as we continue to learn how to navigate the fascinating intersection between medicine and technology, which will only continue to converge in the future."

    "text": "danielleritz.shala@health.nsw.gov.au\nWhat makes working in intensive care different? For me, it’s the criticality of time, patient care, communication, technology, and priorities. Working in this type of environment forces people to prioritise ruthlessly and find efficient ways of doing tasks–partly to save time, but mostly to be ready and focused for the next unpredictable certainty (e.g. a baby who starts off crying like a rockstar and shortly turns blue, a toddler who’s woken up thrashing around and removing the breathing tube while the nurse was on break, a massive drop in blood pressure hours after a heart surgery, etc). As I was working clinically, I observed that copying and pasting is used by some clinicians to complete their electronic documentation quicker. Unfortunately, some would inadvertently enter a progress note on the wrong patient’s record, and others would forget to update a copied note with relevant changes in a patient’s status or therapy settings. As I experienced the reality of these risks on the floor, I noted there was a problem. I could see how the scenarios were generally a result of earnest efforts to use technology smartly and more efficiently, however there was also potential for unintended harm.\nI have always been interested in the use (and perhaps misuse and abuse) of technology in healthcare, particularly its implications in real-world settings. I was attending local and international informatics conferences around 2017/18, and was also having informal chats with doctors and nurses about electronic medical record (eMR) documentation and efficiency in general, as I was curious to find out their experiences and perspectives. Through these discussions I realised that while most people assume redundancies, duplications, and copying and pasting happens “a lot” in clinical documentation, there was no measure, nor existing information around it—at least none that I could find in the local, state, or national level. This was another problem I noted. I believe discussions and decisions around eMR documentation and clinical practice would be more productive if guided by both data AND context—two constructs which I think should never be separated, particularly in healthcare. It was then that I became more interested in quantifying text similarity in clinical progress notes, and establishing a baseline measure for it in a local Australian setting.\nAt the time I was working part time as an ICU nurse, and part time as a research intern at the network, and towards the end of the internship, I proposed a research study and applied for grant funding to work on the study. I was also keen to learn new ways to explore and analyse data, and had just started the Health Data Science course at this time, so it was a perfect opportunity to apply university concepts to a project based on real-world experiences. The resulting study, Measuring text similarity and its associated factors in electronic nursing progress notes: A retrospective review1, was published in 2022 in the Journal of Clinical Nursing. The paper is also available in a shorter open access version, titled Need We Say More? Measuring Redundancy in Nursing Progress Notes2 published by the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press."

    "text": "What did I learn from working on a real-world project?\n\nExperience with real eMR data and manipulating messy datasets for a specific clinical context\nFor this study, I was given two separate datasets: one containing patient details, and another containing progress notes. It was quite messy as it contained notes for an entire patient stay, with varying note structures and lengths. At first it may sound fairly straightforward to identify text that has been copied and pasted, and the data scientist in us would be very excited to code some form of regular expressions (regex) or clustering algorithm to help in detecting the notes required—but consider that this is “a step to a step” which could also take time and would need testing depending on your level of programming experience and exposure to the text. In my case, I was early in my HDS programming journey.\nI dedicated a period to run and test the first option, but noticed that there are notes that either get excluded or included which didn’t fit the study criteria. For example, if I filtered just by the category type (e.g. nursing progress note) and location (e.g. ICU), I ended up including notes from specialist nurses who visit ICU patients. Some of them may have a “Clinical Nurse Specialist” title in the system, others may have a “Registered Nurse” title. While some with the title “Registered Nurse” will do a progress note, not all of them will do a shift summary progress note for a patient. Some followed a specific format for writing shift summary notes, but others didn’t. It was definitely interesting for me to see the scenarios and variations of what happens in practice, and how these were reflected in the data!\nOverall, I had to find ways to match the notes and filter down to only what I needed—this was a great way to apply what I knew as a clinician, what I was learning in Python and practically working with Pandas and numpy! I decided not to skip the manual task of annotating the relevant notes and classifying whether they were done in ICU or not. This meant checking over a thousand notes individually, confirming that they were indeed shift summary notes, done by a nurse, and in ICU. Supervised machine learning could be an alternative to this, but for most machine learning tasks, having correctly labelled data or the “ground truth” would be ideal. While this step took considerable time, it was definitely worthwhile, as it has allowed me to understand our practice deeper and learn more about the nuances of clinical text.\n\n\n\nDanielle is a Clinician and Data Scientist with applied experience in the use of health data in clinical, research, and industry settings. (author supplied)\n\n\n\n\nStarting with simple and practical methods to answer a question and fit a defined context\nThere’s a plethora of methods, studies, and repos that can address a question/problem these days (and there’s chatGPT too!). As more and more sophisticated programs and analytical techniques have sprung up in recent years, it’s easy to get excited and carried away by the next shiny library/tool and lose sight of the core question being solved. For me, the true challenge for a data scientist lies in finding the right fit for the problem at hand.\nI read about different ways of calculating similarity—each had its own strengths, limitations, and implications. I tested and compared results across a few methods but found minimal differences in the results. After awhile I took a step back and reflected on the purpose and context of the study: from here, I settled on a method that might give results that are closer to the visual recognition of repetitive text, or mimic the feeling of “I think I’ve read that part!” among clinicians, as this relates more to the broader concerns of cognitive overload, efficiency, and value of text repetition in ICUs.\nAs it was an exploratory study, part of my goal was also to set a foundation that others may build on and contribute to the body of knowledge around the topic of electronic clinical documentation, especially for nurses. There’s lots of room for improving the study, but that in itself is part of the journey and the learning! This makes reflection on real-world findings, evidence-based recommendations, and learning different ways to tackle a question/problem possible.\nKnowing the problem/question, the purpose and context of the work, and resisting the urge to reinvent the wheel is also useful. Where there are existing methods and libraries, build on them and get creative. One may gain theoretical/academic brownie points as with increasing the complexity of a program/solution, but that may also mean that it’s less applicable, reproducible, or practical in a real world setting. Breaking down problems and simplifying solutions are superpowers, and one can build on these skills by reflecting on work and progress regularly.\n\n\nWorking with engaged leaders and supervisors and communicating with other teams to progress goals\nThe endless possibilities of programming may be exciting to us data scientists, but that wouldn’t always translate to another person. Communicating technical concepts to non-technical groups or individuals was perhaps one of the most challenging and rewarding parts of the project for me. This is something that I definitely picked up in the real world, and something that I sought out to do, as I wanted to use my clinical background and early HDS skills to bridge gaps across clinical, technical, and leadership teams.\nLearning to engage with key contacts from other departments is also important in the success of a project. For example, as I was preparing our ethics application, I sought advice from the research and ethics department and clarified points that we were unsure about. I learned a great deal about the process, and their team became acquainted with our project early on. It took a number of back and forth discussions with contacts but in the end, we saved considerable time as our application was approved on first submission. This would not have been possible without my supportive and empowering supervisor who was patient in listening to my ideas, and tremendously helpful in framing and consolidating them for applications and presentations. It’s always helpful to seek and receive feedback, particularly from experts who have already been through a similar process.\nAnother example demonstrating the importance of communication for the project was liaising with the medical records team. The initial dataset supplied to me was very large and didn’t look “right”. You’ll know this as you perform exploratory data analysis and find values that are either out of range or out of the context of your study. While I was excited that I’ve received the data (finally!), I knew I couldn’t use it for preparation and analysis yet, and had to have discussions with the person who extracted the data. Apart from going back to the data request form and project protocol, it was helpful for us to have meetings where we could walk through these together and quickly clarify questions. The extract took more time due to this, but in the end it worked out as the dataset was also halved and more aligned with the study requirements.\nOverall, working on a project based on a real world healthcare setting was a great way for me to apply my domain knowledge as a clinician while refining my skills as a data scientist. I enjoyed the highs and lows of the project—both on the technical and “soft” aspects as it exposed me to a variety of scenarios and unforeseen challenges, and encouraged me to become more adaptable, creative, and focused in my approaches. There are plenty of ideas and ideals we would like translated in the real world, but the cold hard truth is it isn’t as easy as “1,2,3” or “if A, then B.” The tools we have now and the bright promise of rapidly evolving techniques in data science will not be maximised if not applied to real world problems and data. I would highly encourage anyone to get involved and get their hands dirty with existing projects—apart from the opportunity to build on technical skills, it teaches a great deal of practical lessons about communication, project and time management, and collaboration which are all highly useful in driving projects forward, growing in your practice, having fun, and hopefully, making a difference!"

    "text": "How it started\nI embarked on the journey of completing my Masters in Health Data Science in late 2018. I had been mulling over the idea of post grad study for a while at that point but had not seen anything that really took my interest. I think I might have actually seen an add for this degree on Facebook and decided to take closer look. The appeal for me was the mix of data science with a clinical skew that would have application in my current work.\nI put in an application and was successful to start in the first term of 2019. At the time I was a full fee paying student (via HECS). I decided I would just do one subject per term to make sure I could manage the workload without impacting the rest of family too much."

    "section": "Managing Obstacles",
    "text": "Managing Obstacles\n\nTime\nI was fortunate enough that I was able to negotiate flexible working hours which allowed me to work a full-time load over 4 days which left me the Friday every week to study. Thanks to the technological aspirations of the course, pretty much all the content was available online and there was only a few subject I missed the tutes for which I made up for by engaging online.\nWeek to week I would work through what I could during the evenings when I had free time and then finish things off on the Friday. Some weeks I would have the Friday free to attend to other duties because I already had experience in the course content for that week. Then I would generally spend extra time on the weekends to get on top of assignment deadlines.\nAt the start of each term I would map out the course deadlines on my calendar. I would make a plan for spending extra time on the assignments (I always used it). The week to week work was generally okay but if it was heavy and you got an assignment on top, it made it more difficult to keep on top. I always prioritised work that would give marks.\nI will say that my wife was amazing through the whole degree even though she definitely got frustrated at times. It can be difficult to balance the time commitments of study, work and family life. I would not recommend undertaking them without the full support of your significant other (if that is your situation).\n\n\n\nJason pictured with his family (author supplied)\n\n\n\n\nFamily\nIn 2020, we had a second child join us. We called him our COVID baby. This period was initially very agreeable to studying as pretty well everyone had to stay at home. I was considered frontline staff so still had to go to work but my wife was on maternity leave. All the course content was already online. It was just a case of continuing the practices I had started in 2019.\nIn 2021, restrictions were lifted and things started to open up more. My wife went back to work three days a week. Both kids were in day care four days a week. We still managed to work things so that both my wife and I had a day at home each without the kids. For me it was largely to study, for my wife it was to get a break and catch up on things.\n\n\nExpenses\nThe cost of a Masters can be prohibitive. I had a requirement through my employer to be working towards a higher degree so there was incentive to maintain studies based on that. However, after paying $3,500+ per subject we were beginning to feel the pinch. There were no Commonwealth Supported Places (CSP) when I had originally applied however, I had been keeping in touch with the Program Director (Sabita then Andrew) to see if there were any opportunities. Towards the end of 2020 the federal government had announced additional funding for STEM placements but I found out that they were only going to apply to new applicants. So at the end of 2020 I withdrew from my Masters and reapplied to commence in Term 1 2021. My gamble for securing a CSP paid off. My course fees went from around $4,000 to around $900!"

To say I was chuffed would be an understatement.\nWriting out what I’ve been through for this blog makes it sound like it was actually a pretty straightforward thing to do. I haven’t gone into the depths of how we also moved house twice, sold a house, bought a house, changed the kids to different day care centres, plus managing all the routine day-to-day life things that get thrown at you. Not to mention work deadlines that come up as well! These are all the small things that suck up your time, often at critical moments because they are largely unplanned.\nWhat did I do to ensure that I was successful?\n\nMade sure my wife was on board\nGave myself a solid chunk of flexible time\nAttempted to use up other spare time before I got to my allocated time (if things were under control when I got to my allocated time then it could be used as free time or time for doing other things)\nNegotiated additional time requirements with my wife when needed (usually for assignments)\nPrioritised work that gave marks\n\nOne other thing that I think is important in a situation like this. If you aren’t in a position where you are relying on others to accomplish things then it doesn’t matter as much but I very much was. It was important to me that the time I was spending on study was not wasted. I felt a strong obligation to succeed in all the courses because I did not want the time I was taking away to be wasted."

    "text": "What publication are you most proud of?\nAs a biostatistician, I’ve been involved in a variety of interesting research projects, with a variety of topics (much like our future health data scientists). The paper closest to my heart would be my first PhD paper on the variation of recording of common health conditions in routine hospital data available1. You’ll hear researchers talk about their ‘babies’, and this one was the first one where I had control of the process from start to finish. And I could combine my love of linked data and advanced statistical methods. It was a starting point of my work in chronic disease and multimorbidity, which are my current research interest.\nAn example of a slow burning one would be the one from my Masters’ degree days back in 2008! It was titled Pandemic influenza in Australia: using telephone surveys to measure perceptions of threat and willingness to comply2. I devised a survey, pilot tested it and then analysed the data on perceptions of the threat of pandemic influenza and how people will behave in the event of it occurring. Little did I know that come 2020 all that work will be so very topical! We looked at how likely people were to be vaccinated, isolated and wear a face mask. Deja vu much!"

Yes, I do have that as a motto in the class. With piling workload, it’s more imperative than ever to have that skill, and to keep things on track and under control.\nFrom HDAT9100 Context of Health Data Science—keep a list of useful resources and websites. Aggregate data and government reports have a wealth of information which will be useful to you in getting the background information, as well as checking whether your results make sense.\nFor statistical subjects and projects more generally—think about your research question/hypothesis. This is what drives the analysis and interpretation. Always make sure you have your key research questions at the forefront of your mind when you are analysing data. This prevents you from going down too many rabbit holes (and yes, analysts do love analysis!)\nFor programming tasks—think, plan and do. Think of what dataset/analysis you need to answer your question and work backwards from there. Pen and paper will be your best friends as you try and figure out how those outcomes, confounders and variables will need to be derived. Once that’s clear, start coding. And checking. And double checking!"

Twenty years later, climate scientists from Japan, analysed decades of satellite data to prove that my prediction was correct and that this coupling can help to explain climate events such as the abnormally hot Northern Hemisphere summer of 2018 (see Science2).\nAs a postdoc, while doing research in environmental economics, I formulated a way for allocating responsibility for production impacts consistently amongst all agents throughout demand and supply chains, in a way that reflects their contribution to the production process (see Economic Systems Research3). This formulation is now in used in environmental accounting software (see Green is good for business.\nOn the topic of predictive algorithms in Medicine, I led the first non-disease-specific model that dynamically and simultaneously predicted the future daily probability of remaining days of hospitalization, death, and readmission (see Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association)4. This model allowed for the real-time identification of patient trajectories forecasting expected discharge, expected continuing hospitalization, and expected death. It was featured in the 2016 edition of Stories of Australian Science."

Obtaining actionable insights (or revealing the hidden signals) from such data requires the utilisation of probabilistic concepts. Thus a solid understanding of the principles of statistics is intrinsic to Health Data Science. The aim of this first course in probability theory is to introduce the foundations required to understand such phenomena.\nThe course design is highly innovative and novel. Statistical computing is used to gain a sound understanding of statistical theories and concepts. Specifically, this course draws on the practical application of Monte Carlo algorithms, which are a very effective method of statistical computing. Once this illustrative approach has (a posteriori) demonstrated a theory, it will then be stated formally.\nThe core content will be delivered through a flipped approach utilising audio-visual excerpts on the Moodle TELT platform, supported by presentations from Centre for Big Data Research in Health (CBDRH) experts. Statistical computing will be used as the process that drives the content. Peer instruction via discussion during face-to-face sessions will offer support in the form of collaborative learning. Active participation will be encouraged throughout, along with a reflective outlook."

The ability to write clear, efficient and correct computer code is at the core of most data science practice and is a foundation skill set.\nIn this course, you will learn to program in the Python language through tackling health-related problems. Topics include data types, functions, data processing, simulation, software development and program testing and debugging. Theoretical principles are reinforced with extensive ‘hands-on’ coding in Python, including the NumPy and Pandas packages.\nThe course is accessed via www.openlearning.com. Core material will be delivered as short lectures and readings supported by interactive coding activities. Practical exercises will utilise Spyder/Jupyter Notebook documents."

Starting with linear regression, a major theme of the course is best practice in model fitting, including thorough exploratory data analysis, model assumption checking, data preparation and transformation, including the use of imputation, and careful attention to model adequacy and diagnostics. Emphasis is given to content-aware, purposive model building and the use of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of causal relations to inform model parameter selection. Non-linear, logistic, binomial and Poisson models for count data are also covered. Effect modifications (interactions) and their meaning in a health context are explored. The presentation and visualisation of statistical models is considered, with emphasis on the explanatory insights that can be gained from well-constructed models. The final part of the course covers basic time-series models, survival analysis and other time-to-event models."

Building on Health Data Analytics: Statistical Modelling I (HDAT9600), this course expands the statistical toolkit and broadens students’ understanding of relevant statistical approaches for the analysis of realistically complex data structures and research questions. The course is aimed at those currently working or planning on working in health or a health-related field, and who are interested in applying advanced statistical methods to analyse complex data.\nTopics covered in this course include multilevel models for hierarchical data; analysis of time series and longitudinal data; quasi-experimental approaches for drawing causal inferences from observational data; multiple imputation for missing values; and simulation approaches for study planning and model evaluation.\nContent is delivered through a combination of online readings, expert guest lectures and practical hands-on tutorials. Statistical concepts are illustrated with a variety of health examples, and students will learn how to implement methods using leading statistical software. Lectures are followed by weekly exercises, which reinforce the learning and programming skills covered in the face-to-face tutorials."

The overarching aim is to facilitate the bigger picture of Health Data Science (HDS); the student experiences the HDS pipeline from start-to-end. Thus, the student is presented with the opportunity to bring all the content of the Graduate Diploma together, realising the relative ordering and merits of each stage. This capstone has the advantage of allowing a further 18 units of credit of broadening electives to be undertaken.\nThe capstone project involves completing extensive, desk-based, independent research tasks, requiring the use of the R and/or Python programming languages. An entire HDS project has been constructed and sliced into the respective stages of the HDS pipeline. At each stage, the student has the option of completing minor or major tasks to progress to the next stage. For example, at the ‘Curation’ stage, a minor task might be a short-written report (circa 1,000 words) identifying the issues to be addressed. A major task would involve preparation of a data management plan (DMP; circa 3,000 words). Each task will be assigned a point score based on its complexity, proportional to the expected (notional) time required to complete the task. To complete the course, will require successful completion of three minor and two major tasks.\nStudents are required to complete Graduate Diploma in Health Data Science (5372) to a satisfactory standing to be admitted onto this course."

At the time, there was limited information available on the logistics of delivering vaccinations at scale so in this study we used a special class of model—queue network models—to try to figure out the sweet spot between number of vaccinations per day, staffing levels and target processing times.\nI love this paper because it was addressing a very real and practical question. To inform the analysis I spent time at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital COVID Vaccination Clinic speaking to the health staff preparing and delivering vaccinations to better understand the process we were modelling. I also presented the completed work to the NSW Health Sydney Local Health District, as they prepared to set up their mass vaccination hub at Olympic Park.\nThe other nice aspect of this paper was the many ways we made the work accessible. To accompany the analysis we developed a shiny app that allows users to rerun our models, or to run alternative queuing models based on their own circumstances (number of staff, target daily vaccinations etc). As a companion to the academic paper, we also published an article in The Conversation to help share the lessons from our work as broadly as possible. Finally, all of the code from the analysis was made available on GitHub, following best practice for open science and reproducibility."

In particular, we trained and validated a gradient-boosted tree machine learning (ML) algorithm to forecast patient blood glucose and a 95% prediction interval at 2-hour intervals. Our forecasting model using routinely collected EMRs achieved performance comparable to previous models developed in planned research studies using continuous blood glucose monitoring.

At that time, memory (RAM) was limited and expensive, and disc storage was mechanical and slow. Real-time exploration of larger datasets that would not fit in memory (RAM) was not really feasible. I developed a method of pre-computing ordered inverted indices for every column in a dataset, memory-mapping stored versions of these on disc, and then using set operations on those to rapidly subset and cross-tabulate (or visualise) the data in a fraction of a second, much faster than traditional database technologies. The software was released as an open-source package. It had very little impact on anything, although it was used inside NSW Ministry of Health to examine communicable disease and emergency department public health surveillance data for some time. Nonetheless, it was a clever approach, it worked well and both the idea and its implementation (in Python and C) was developed entirely by me.\nChurches T.

    "text": "mamiya_adachi@yahoo.co.jp\n\n\n https://www.linkedin.com/in/mamiyaad/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManny Adachi is an aspiring data scientist from Japan in the Master’s program in Health Data Science. His interests are in motorcycle touring, traveling, and of course data science!!\nThis is a short post about my participation in the SAS Cortex Analytics Simulation 5 Day Challenge (hereafter, Cortex) in April 2022. Luckily, I became the 1st place winner in the competition. It is not a direct application of what we have learned in the HDS program to the formal job scene. However, I think it can still provide you some idea of how much knowledge we can use outside the classes. Please also see the post by Lucia Biasi from SAS Australia for some details of the interview on me about my experience.\n\nWhat is Cortex?\nCortex is an analytics simulation game developed by SAS and HEC Montreal. It tests participants’ predictive modeling skills using a real-life problem as they compete against peers. The game scenario was to help a fictitious non-profit organization which needed to figure out who to contact from a list of potential donors. Using SAS Enterprise Miner, participants built a predictive model and generated a contact list to maximise the surplus amount (i.e. donation amount – cost of contacting). For the duration of Cortex, participants were allowed to revise the contact list up to around 30 times. The prior versions were also maintained in the system so participants are able to select their best contact list later on.\n\n\nWhat did I learn through Cortex?\nIt was my first and fun experience using a GUI (Graphic User Interface)-based tool to construct a pipeline of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and testing. The Cortex GUI allows users to interact with tools through icons, menus, and mouse. Therefore, it is more intuitive for the uses to have a control of the tool than entirely coding the required tasks. Although the tools we used in the school assignments such as Jupyter Notebook, R Studio, and SAS Studio have GUI components, with Cortex we could complete the tasks mostly without coding. It was, of course, way more convenient than mostly coding like we did for the school assignments. I could spend more time on thinking how to optimize the surplus amount (e.g., comparing the result using different base models and (hyper)parameters, how to minimize overfitting, deciding where to cut the list from the model (*cutting was done manually and still acceptable)).\n\n\n\nA pipeline diagram constructed on Cortex by Harry Ngo, a participant back in 2020. My final pipeline and final model were different from the above, but it should provide you a sufficient visualization of how things went\n\n\nSo, am I here just as a shill and say how brilliant the SAS platform was? No (although I know that I am already helping them…). Instead, I really want to emphasize that what ends up making the difference sometimes are something beyond knowing how to code a fancy and complex statistical or machine learning model. In my case during Cortex, what helped me were (1) the base knowledge from HDS about the characteristics of each machine learning model, (2) how to read the training / validation score graphs, (3) the strategy of submission time to minimize the other competitors’ time to revise their lists (i.e., submitting the best list when the game was approaching to the end and other competitors appeared satisfied with the moderate but not the best list), and (4) the persistency until the very last minute of the game.\nHere is a little more comment about (1). Although I cannot mention which model I used for my final contact list, I can say it helped me avoid overfitting my model and possibly bluff the other competitors with the list from the overfit model. It was one example of how we can apply our knowledge from HDS program to strategize our action.\n Learn more about the Cortex analytics simulation game at www.sas.com/cortex\n\n\nWinning the game, then what?\nAs the winner, I was offered the badge and 4-week internship at SAS Australia. During the internship I was able to (1) connect with SAS members in various teams such as technical support, pre / post-sales, delivery consulting, and customer success and learn about their roles and offerings, (2) access the study materials for SAS Viya programming associate exam for free, and (3) earn the certificate after passing the exam. Beside the time to connect with SAS members, I spent the majority of time studying for the exam, so it is indeed a large part of what I have learned through the internship. One thing I hoped to do was to practice how to integrate the models that we build with external sources such as Python or R. The integration is one of the key highlights on SAS Viya’s capability.\nI have to confess that I did not know much about the company and what they offer until several days after my internship started. (Please don’t blame me on this since obviously I got this internship opportunity without any interviews). In short, they offer the solutions which support the operations in the whole analytics life cycle, and they have been the long-established and leading vendor of the statistical data analysis software for various sectors such as government / public service, healthcare, banking / finance, and academia. You can also learn more about SAS from a post by Emmett Boudreau.\n\n\nConclusion\nI definitely recommend other students to participate in the Cortex competition hosted by SAS (or any hackathon events). It gives us not only the data science experience outside of class, but also the chance to have our hands on the analytics platforms used in the industry and connect with other participants and sometimes people from industry."

    "text": "Combining work and study early in the degree\nI commenced the HDS Masters in 2019, while working as a junior doctor. Prior to this, I had completed an undergraduate research year with the Center for Big Data Research in Health as part of my medical degree, which I really enjoyed and I was interested in maintaining options for non-clinical work. The main advice I have for any junior doctors doing the course is that ward work is unpredictable, and a work-study schedule that looks reasonable on paper can be easily thrown off by unrostered overtime! I found it much easier to manage the course on shiftwork-based terms. My experience was that I could only ever manage one subject at a time, except for one term which was 4 days on, 4 off, 4 nights, 4 off, when I did two subjects."

I also hoped to remain in Darwin, where I was living and working. I approached the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin, and was introduced to Professor Steven Guthridge, who was open to formulating the project based on their current research areas that were relevant to the NT, and supervising my research project, along with co-supervision from a UNSW academic. I really loved the Machine Learning chapter of the course and so I approached Dr Oscar Perez-Concha, who agreed to co-supervise my project, which was fantastic.\n\n\n\nLucinda pictured presenting to the judges at Royal Darwin Hospital in late 2021 (author supplied)\n\n\nWorking at the Menzies School of Health Research, specifically within the Child and Youth Development Research Partnership (CYDRP) was a highlight of my experience. The team at Menzies were very generous in integrating me into their workplace and I felt like a valued member and contributor to their team. CYDRP also have an amazing resource for retrospective analysis: a population-level linked database spanning 14 different datasets.\nOnce I had completed the research project, I was fortunate to receive a doctors in training research award for a presentation on the project.\n\n\n\n\nLucinda receiving a Doctors in Training research award (author supplied)"

    "text": "Lessons learned\nBecause of the opportunity for uninterrupted work, I delved deeply into the area of dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques using unsupervised machine learning. I had intended to have the project completed, and a manuscript submitted by the end of the six-month period. I found it hard to ‘draw the line’ and possibly delved too deeply into the subject matter, and instead had just completed a first draft at the end of the six-month period. Based on the amount of work done, there was possibly sufficient material for a second paper comparing clustering methodologies, however to make this paper relevant and concise, we elected to use 2 rather than all 6 of the various models that we had made. The main lesson for me was to set realistic expectations about what is achievable in a limited time frame, especially when you want to develop a deep understanding of new and complex subject matter. Perhaps this is an unavoidable trap for a junior researcher.\nWe submitted a manuscript to PLoS One in February 2022, a couple of months after completing the MSc Program in December 2021. Finding reviewers for the manuscript took some time because of the unusual combination of subject matter and analytical methods (early childhood development and using unsupervised machine learning). Revisions to the paper were made in mid-2022, based on reviewer feedback. Balancing this with full-time work and study for medical exams was a challenge; I am indebted to my supervisors/co-authors for their help with revisions. The final manuscript, titled Complex early childhood experiences: Characteristics of Northern Territory children across health, education and child protection data1 was accepted for publication at the end of 2022."

    "text": "Calum.Nicholson@hri.org.au\n\n\n hri.org.au/our-research/clinical-research/mr-calum-nicholson\n\n\n linkedin.com/in/calum-nicholson-13b256171\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalum has been working with the Heart Research Institute since 2018 and he is the National Coordinator for an Australia-wide congenital heart disease (CHD) registry.\nCalum completed the MSc Health Data Science in 2021. His dissertation used geographical information and analysis techniques to assist with service delivery planning for adults with Congenital Heart Disease an was published in PLOS Digital Health.\n\nThe need for literate programming\nWorking as data scientists, our analyses are useless if they cannot be communicated with our collaborators and audiences. Especially when working with topic area specialists such as clinicians, public health experts or clinical researchers, presenting the results of our data analysis is essential. Literate programming techniques are tools that allow for the combination of conventional word processing with code for data analysis. These tools have fast become one of the most useful tools that I was taught during my time completing the Master of Health Data Science with the Centre for Big Data Research in Health. Of course, you still need the key skills of a data scientist—data management, statistics, and visualisation—otherwise there would be nothing to include in a report! However, working with people who do not have the access to the analytic software that you might use means that we need to be able to take our analyses out of these systems so that other people can engage with our work.\nMarkdown is a common form of implementing a literature programming technique. It is a mark-up language that is used to format text documents. Unlike Microsoft Word, which is a WYSIWYG (/ˈwɪziwɪɡ/ WIZ-ee-wig, i.e. what you see is what you get!) editor, where changes are to text formatting are seen immediately, Markdown uses specific syntax to create formatted text. This does require learning some of the markdown language, but you can mostly get by with knowing a few basics such as headings, lists, and bold and italic text. There are many different tools that combine markdown language with code, Jupyter Notebook is a common one that works with many different coding languages. My experience is mostly with R Markdown from R Studio, which is an excellent tool for literate programming.\nI work for the Heart Research Institute, coordinating a project that is developing a Bi-National Registry for Congenital Heart Disease in Australia and New Zealand. In this role we have moved through data collection, cleaning, and analysis phases. In all these areas, using literate programming tools to generate reports have become a key part of my workflows. I am often collaborating with clinical staff, often cardiologists, nurses, and neuropsychologists, to produce various outputs and these outputs are always a HTML report using R Markdown.\n\n\nData Collection Reports: did I receive that data that I think I did?\nData collection for our registry involves receiving extracts for clinical data sources, often with hundreds of thousands of records. It is important to make sure that the data that we receive is what was intended to be sent. To aid these processes, I have developed data collection reports using R Markdown. These simply overview everything that was received, with some simple exploratory data analysis. These reports often go back to data managers and clinicians and provide a very useful sanity check that can identify simple mistakes early in the process.\n\nOutputCode\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerating consort diagrams with ggconsort A flow diagram for patient selection into the ACHD registry.

This has always been difficult to implement in R and has usually required some manual development in a Microsoft Office application. However, I have recently discovered the ggconsort package that is great for making Consort-Style flowchart. This package can create simple consort diagrams that are perfect for demonstrating how a target population was reached. It uses very familiar dplyr and ggplot2 workflows that make it quite easy to pick up for those who are already familiar with the tidyverse.\n\n\nData Analysis: collaborating with topic area specialists.\nRecently, I have been working with neuropsychologists to analyse data in preparation for manuscripts. Unsurprisingly, I know very little about neuropsychology and the neuropsychologists have never used R before! Using literate programming as an iterative process to complete data analysis for a manuscript can really help bridge the gap between disciplines. Ideally, I would want to hand over my analyses with enough clarity that my collaborators can assess my methodologies from their expert perspectives and then write up their results and methods sections using only my reports. This requires not only providing the analysis but including some notes and comments about methodology used for cohort selection and statistical analysis. Since literate programming allows you to write prose alongside your code, it provides a great process for clearing writing out your methods right alongside the analysis and results. You can provide exactly what you think should be included in a manuscript to describe your analysis and your collaborators won’t have to try decipher your code to understand what you are doing.\n\nOutputCode\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating Summary Tables with qrwraps2 Summary statistics for patients who had completed a DASS-21 survey (example from a recent poster). Toggle to the code tab to see the underlying code.\n\n\n\n\nThe code below uses the summary_table() function from the qwraps package to create a nice summary table.

Of these outputs, creating publication-ready tables has always been the most challenging to implement in the flow of an R Markdown report. There are packages like knitr and kableExtra that can format tables nicely, but I have found that creating the tables to go into this format can often be difficult and time consuming. I have recently found a great package called qwraps2 that has a lot of functions for reproducible reporting and summary_table() is probably my new favourite. It allows you to create a template table format that can be applied to your data. This allows for a very flexible and reproducible way to create summary tables of your data. It is especially useful for providing a demographic overview of your study population.\n\n\nWhere to start with literate programming?\nTo get started with literate programming in R check out the RMarkdown website at rmarkdown.rstudio.com. You’ll find step-by-step instructions to get started as well as a gallery of examples with heaps of inspiration! The qwraps2 package has a detailed vignette showing how to build a variety of summary tables. Python users can check out Jupyter Notebooks from the Jupyter community."
