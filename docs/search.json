We look at how health outcomes can be measured and reported in various forms of health data, and how these health data can reveal inequalities in health. The course describes the major sources of health data, including those relating to primary care, hospital stays and prescription medicines, and how this (and other) information can be used by the health data scientist to create evidence for policy and research.\nActivities are structured to foster a scientific, questioning attitude in the student. Students are encouraged to think critically about how health data are recorded, what this reveals about the underlying health delivery systems, and be creative in their use of health data sources to create or critically appraise evidence."

Obtaining actionable insights (or revealing the hidden signals) from such data requires the utilisation of probabilistic concepts. Thus a solid understanding of the principles of statistics is intrinsic to Health Data Science. The aim of this first course in probability theory is to introduce the foundations required to understand such phenomena.\nThe course design is highly innovative and novel. Statistical computing is used to gain a sound understanding of statistical theories and concepts. Specifically, this course draws on the practical application of Monte Carlo algorithms, which are a very effective method of statistical computing. Once this illustrative approach has (a posteriori) demonstrated a theory, it will then be stated formally.\nThe core content will be delivered through a flipped approach utilising audio-visual excerpts on the Moodle TELT platform, supported by presentations from Centre for Big Data Research in Health (CBDRH) experts. Statistical computing will be used as the process that drives the content. Peer instruction via discussion during face-to-face sessions will offer support in the form of collaborative learning. Active participation will be encouraged throughout, along with a reflective outlook."

Thus, the student is presented with the opportunity to bring all the content of the Graduate Diploma together, realising the relative ordering and merits of each stage. This capstone has the advantage of allowing a further 18 units of credit of broadening electives to be undertaken.\nThe capstone project involves completing extensive, desk-based, independent research tasks, requiring the use of the R and/or Python programming languages. An entire HDS project has been constructed and sliced into the respective stages of the HDS pipeline. At each stage, the student has the option of completing minor or major tasks to progress to the next stage. For example, at the ‘Curation’ stage, a minor task might be a short-written report (circa 1,000 words) identifying the issues to be addressed. A major task would involve preparation of a data management plan (DMP; circa 3,000 words). Each task will be assigned a point score based on its complexity, proportional to the expected (notional) time required to complete the task. To complete the course, will require successful completion of three minor and two major tasks.\nStudents are required to complete Graduate Diploma in Health Data Science (5372) to a satisfactory standing to be admitted onto this course."

The proposed methodological solution is both elegant in its design and fully flexible in allowing expansion to model more complex scenarios. Implicit in the paper, is the need for carefully considered ‘meaning making’ whenever investigating casual links."

Twenty years later, climate scientists from Japan, analysed decades of satellite data to prove that my prediction was correct and that this coupling can help to explain climate events such as the abnormally hot Northern Hemisphere summer of 2018 (see Science2).\nAs a postdoc, while doing research in environmental economics, I formulated a way for allocating responsibility for production impacts consistently amongst all agents throughout demand and supply chains, in a way that reflects their contribution to the production process (see Economic Systems Research3). This formulation is now in used in environmental accounting software (see Green is good for business.\nOn the topic of predictive algorithms in Medicine, I led the first non-disease-specific model that dynamically and simultaneously predicted the future daily probability of remaining days of hospitalization, death, and readmission (see Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association)4. This model allowed for the real-time identification of patient trajectories forecasting expected discharge, expected continuing hospitalization, and expected death.

At the time, there was limited information available on the logistics of delivering vaccinations at scale so in this study we used a special class of model—queue network models—to try to figure out the sweet spot between number of vaccinations per day, staffing levels and target processing times.\nI love this paper because it was addressing a very real and practical question. Before starting the I spent time at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital COVID Vaccination Clinic speaking to the health staff preparing and delivering vaccinations to better understand the process we were modelling. I also presented the completed work to the NSW Health Sydney Local Health District, as they prepared to set up their mass vaccination hub at Olympic Park.\nThe other thing I thought went well with this paper is the many ways we made the work accessible. To accompany the analysis we developed a shiny app that allows users to rerun our models, or to run alternative queuing models based on their own circumstances (number of staff, target daily vaccinations etc). As a companion to the academic paper, we also published an article in The Conversation to help share the lessons from our work as broadly as possible. Finally, all of the code from the analysis was made available on GitHub, following best practice for open science and reproducibility."

In this paper, we presented a data-driven method for predicting intensive care unit (ICU) patient response to glycemic control protocols while accounting for patient heterogeneity and variations in care. In particular, we trained and validated a gradient-boosted tree machine learning (ML) algorithm to forecast patient blood glucose and a 95% prediction interval at 2-hour intervals. Our forecasting model using routinely collected EMRs achieved performance comparable to previous models developed in planned research studies using continuous blood glucose monitoring.

It was titled Pandemic influenza in Australia: using telephone surveys to measure perceptions of threat and willingness to comply2. I devised a survey, pilot tested it and then analysed the data on perceptions of the threat of pandemic influenza and how people will behave in the event of it occurring. Little did I know that come 2020 all that work will be so very topical! We looked at how likely people were to be vaccinated, isolated and wear a face mask. Deja vu much!"

This prevents you from going down too many rabbit holes (and yes, analysts do love analysis!)\nFor programming tasks—think, plan and do. Think of what dataset/analysis you need to answer your question and work backwards from there.

    "section": "",
    "text": "mamiya_adachi@yahoo.co.jp\n\n\n https://www.linkedin.com/in/mamiyaad/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManny Adachi is an aspiring data scientist from Japan in the Master’s program in Health Data Science. His interests are in motorcycle touring, traveling, and of course data science!!]\nThis is a short post about my participation in the SAS Cortex Analytics Simulation 5 Day Challenge (hereafter, Cortex) in April 2022. Luckily, I became the 1st place winner in the competition. It is not a direct application of what we have learned in the HDS program to the formal job scene. However, I think it can still provide you some idea of how much knowledge we can use outside the classes. Please also see the post by Lucia Biasi from SAS Australia for some details of the interview on me about my experience.\n\nWhat is Cortex?\nCortex is an analytics simulation game developed by SAS and HEC Montreal. It tests participants’ predictive modeling skills using a real-life problem as they compete against peers. The game scenario was to help a fictitious non-profit organization which needed to figure out who to contact from a list of potential donors. Using SAS Enterprise Miner, participants built a predictive model and generated a contact list to maximise the surplus amount (i.e. donation amount – cost of contacting). For the duration of Cortex, participants were allowed to revise the contact list up to around 30 times. The prior versions were also maintained in the system so participants are able to select their best contact list later on.\n\n\nWhat did I learn through Cortex?\nIt was my first and fun experience using a GUI (Graphic User Interface)-based tool to construct a pipeline of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and testing. The Cortex GUI allows users to interact with tools through icons, menus, and mouse. Therefore, it is more intuitive for the uses to have a control of the tool than entirely coding the required tasks. Although the tools we used in the school assignments such as Jupyter Notebook, R Studio, and SAS Studio have GUI components, with Cortex we could complete the tasks mostly without coding. It was, of course, way more convenient than mostly coding like we did for the school assignments. I could spend more time on thinking how to optimize the surplus amount (e.g., comparing the result using different base models and (hyper)parameters, how to minimize overfitting, deciding where to cut the list from the model (*cutting was done manually and still acceptable)).\n\n\n\nA pipeline diagram constructed on Cortex by Harry Ngo, a participant back in 2020. My final pipeline and final model were different from the above, but it should provide you a sufficient visualization of how things went\n\n\nSo, am I here just as a shill and say how brilliant the SAS platform was? No (although I know that I am already helping them…). Instead, I really want to emphasize that what ends up making the difference sometimes are something beyond knowing how to code a fancy and complex statistical or machine learning model. In my case during Cortex, what helped me were (1) the base knowledge from HDS about the characteristics of each machine learning model, (2) how to read the training / validation score graphs, (3) the strategy of submission time to minimize the other competitors’ time to revise their lists (i.e., submitting the best list when the game was approaching to the end and other competitors appeared satisfied with the moderate but not the best list), and (4) the persistency until the very last minute of the game.\nHere is a little more comment about (1). Although I cannot mention which model I used for my final contact list, I can say it helped me avoid overfitting my model and possibly bluff the other competitors with the list from the overfit model. It was one example of how we can apply our knowledge from HDS program to strategize our action.\n Learn more about the Cortex analytics simulation game at www.sas.com/cortex\n\n\nWinning the game, then what?\nAs the winner, I was offered the badge and 4-week internship at SAS Australia. During the internship I was able to (1) connect with SAS members in various teams such as technical support, pre / post-sales, delivery consulting, and customer success and learn about their roles and offerings, (2) access the study materials for SAS Viya programming associate exam for free, and (3) earn the certificate after passing the exam. Beside the time to connect with SAS members, I spent the majority of time studying for the exam, so it is indeed a large part of what I have learned through the internship. One thing I hoped to do was to practice how to integrate the models that we build with external sources such as Python or R. The integration is one of the key highlights on SAS Viya’s capability.\nI have to confess that I did not know much about the company and what they offer until several days after my internship started. (Please don’t blame me on this since obviously I got this internship opportunity without any interviews). In short, they offer the solutions which support the operations in the whole analytics life cycle, and they have been the long-established and leading vendor of the statistical data analysis software for various sectors such as government / public service, healthcare, banking / finance, and academia. You can also learn more about SAS from a post by Emmett Boudreau.\n\n\nConclusion\nI definitely recommend other students to participate in the Cortex competition hosted by SAS (or any hackathon events). It gives us not only the data science experience outside of class, but also the chance to have our hands on the analytics platforms used in the industry and connect with other participants and sometimes people from industry."

    "text": "How it started\nI embarked on the journey of completing my Masters in Health Data Science in late 2018. I had been mulling over the idea of post grad study for a while at that point but had not seen anything that really took my interest. I think I might have actually seen an add for this degree on Facebook and decided to take closer look. The appeal for me was the mix of data science with a clinical skew that would have application in my current work.\nI put in an application and was successful to start in the first term of 2019. At the time I was a full fee paying student (via HECS). I decided I would just do one subject per term to make sure I could manage the workload without impacting the rest of family too much."

    "section": "Managing Obstacles",
    "text": "Managing Obstacles\n\nTime\nI was fortunate enough that I was able to negotiate flexible working hours which allowed me to work a full-time load over 4 days which left me the Friday every week to study. Thanks to the technological aspirations of the course, pretty much all the content was available online and there was only a few subject I missed the tutes for which I made up for by engaging online.\nWeek to week I would work through what I could during the evenings when I had free time and then finish things off on the Friday. Some weeks I would have the Friday free to attend to other duties because I already had experience in the course content for that week. Then I would generally spend extra time on the weekends to get on top of assignment deadlines.\nAt the start of each term I would map out the course deadlines on my calendar. I would make a plan for spending extra time on the assignments (I always used it). The week to week work was generally okay but if it was heavy and you got an assignment on top, it made it more difficult to keep on top. I always prioritised work that would give marks.\nI will say that my wife was amazing through the whole degree even though she definitely got frustrated at times. It can be difficult to balance the time commitments of study, work and family life. I would not recommend undertaking them without the full support of your significant other (if that is your situation).\n\n\n\nJason pictured with his family (author supplied)\n\n\n\n\nFamily\nIn 2020, we had a second child join us. We called him our COVID baby. This period was initially very agreeable to studying as pretty well everyone had to stay at home. I was considered frontline staff so still had to go to work but my wife was on maternity leave. All the course content was already online. It was just a case of continuing the practices I had started in 2019.\nIn 2021, restrictions were lifted and things started to open up more. My wife went back to work three days a week. Both kids were in day care four days a week. We still managed to work things so that both my wife and I had a day at home each without the kids. For me it was largely to study, for my wife it was to get a break and catch up on things.\n\n\nExpenses\nThe cost of a Masters can be prohibitive. I had a requirement through my employer to be working towards a higher degree so there was incentive to maintain studies based on that. However, after paying $3,500+ per subject we were beginning to feel the pinch. There were no Commonwealth Supported Places (CSP) when I had originally applied however, I had been keeping in touch with the Program Director (Sabita then Andrew) to see if there were any opportunities. Towards the end of 2020 the federal government had announced additional funding for STEM placements but I found out that they were only going to apply to new applicants. So at the end of 2020 I withdrew from my Masters and reapplied to commence in Term 1 2021. My gamble for securing a CSP paid off. My course fees went from around $4,000 to around $900!"

To say I was chuffed would be an understatement.\nWriting out what I’ve been through for this blog makes it sound like it was actually a pretty straightforward thing to do. I haven’t gone into the depths of how we also moved house twice, sold a house, bought a house, changed the kids to different day care centres, plus managing all the routine day-to-day life things that get thrown at you. Not to mention work deadlines that come up as well! These are all the small things that suck up your time, often at critical moments because they are largely unplanned.\nWhat did I do to ensure that I was successful?\n\nMade sure my wife was on board\nGave myself a solid chunk of flexible time\nAttempted to use up other spare time before I got to my allocated time (if things were under control when I got to my allocated time then it could be used as free time or time for doing other things)\nNegotiated additional time requirements with my wife when needed (usually for assignments)\nPrioritised work that gave marks\n\nOne other thing that I think is important in a situation like this. If you aren’t in a position where you are relying on others to accomplish things then it doesn’t matter as much but I very much was. It was important to me that the time I was spending on study was not wasted. I felt a strong obligation to succeed in all the courses because I did not want the time I was taking away to be wasted."

Prior to this, I had completed an undergraduate research year with the Center for Big Data Research in Health as part of my medical degree, which I really enjoyed and I was interested in maintaining options for non-clinical work. The main advice I have for any junior doctors doing the course is that ward work is unpredictable, and a work-study schedule that looks reasonable on paper can be easily thrown off by unrostered overtime! I found it much easier to manage the course on shiftwork-based terms. My experience was that I could only ever manage one subject at a time, except for one term which was 4 days on, 4 off, 4 nights, 4 off, when I did two subjects."

I had intended to have the project completed, and a manuscript submitted by the end of the six-month period. I found it hard to ‘draw the line’ and possibly delved too deeply into the subject matter, and instead had just completed a first draft at the end of the six-month period. Based on the amount of work done, there was possibly sufficient material for a second paper comparing clustering methodologies, however to make this paper relevant and concise, we elected to use 2 rather than all 6 of the various models that we had made. The main lesson for me was to set realistic expectations about what is achievable in a limited time frame, especially when you want to develop a deep understanding of new and complex subject matter. Perhaps this is an unavoidable trap for a junior researcher.\nWe submitted a manuscript to PLoS One in February 2022, a couple of months after completing the MSc Program in December 2021. Finding reviewers for the manuscript took some time because of the unusual combination of subject matter and analytical methods (early childhood development and using unsupervised machine learning). Revisions to the paper were made in mid-2022, based on reviewer feedback. Balancing this with full-time work and study for medical exams was a challenge; I am indebted to my supervisors/co-authors for their help with revisions. The final manuscript, titled Complex early childhood experiences: Characteristics of Northern Territory children across health, education and child protection data1 was accepted for publication at the end of 2022."

    "text": "danielleritz.shala@health.nsw.gov.au\nWhat makes working in intensive care different? For me, it’s the criticality of time, patient care, communication, technology, and priorities. Working in this type of environment forces people to prioritise ruthlessly and find efficient ways of doing tasks–partly to save time, but mostly to be ready and focused for the next unpredictable certainty (e.g. a baby who starts off crying like a rockstar and shortly turns blue, a toddler who’s woken up thrashing around and removing the breathing tube while the nurse was on break, a massive drop in blood pressure hours after a heart surgery, etc). As I was working clinically, I observed that copying and pasting is used by some clinicians to complete their electronic documentation quicker. Unfortunately, some would inadvertently enter a progress note on the wrong patient’s record, and others would forget to update a copied note with relevant changes in a patient’s status or therapy settings. As I experienced the reality of these risks on the floor, I noted there was a problem. I could see how the scenarios were generally a result of earnest efforts to use technology smartly and more efficiently, however there was also potential for unintended harm.\nI have always been interested in the use (and perhaps misuse and abuse) of technology in healthcare, particularly its implications in real-world settings. I was attending local and international informatics conferences around 2017/18, and was also having informal chats with doctors and nurses about electronic medical record (eMR) documentation and efficiency in general, as I was curious to find out their experiences and perspectives. Through these discussions I realised that while most people assume redundancies, duplications, and copying and pasting happens “a lot” in clinical documentation, there was no measure, nor existing information around it—at least none that I could find in the local, state, or national level. This was another problem I noted. I believe discussions and decisions around eMR documentation and clinical practice would be more productive if guided by both data AND context—two constructs which I think should never be separated, particularly in healthcare. It was then that I became more interested in quantifying text similarity in clinical progress notes, and establishing a baseline measure for it in a local Australian setting.\nAt the time I was working part time as an ICU nurse, and part time as a research intern at the network, and towards the end of the internship, I proposed a research study and applied for grant funding to work on the study. I was also keen to learn new ways to explore and analyse data, and had just started the Health Data Science course at this time, so it was a perfect opportunity to apply university concepts to a project based on real-world experiences. The resulting study, Measuring text similarity and its associated factors in electronic nursing progress notes: A retrospective review1, was published in 2022 in the Journal of Clinical Nursing. The paper is also available in a shorter open access version, titled Need We Say More? Measuring Redundancy in Nursing Progress Notes2 published by the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press."

    "text": "What did I learn from working on a real-world project?\n\nExperience with real eMR data and manipulating messy datasets for a specific clinical context\nFor this study, I was given two separate datasets: one containing patient details, and another containing progress notes. It was quite messy as it contained notes for an entire patient stay, with varying note structures and lengths. At first it may sound fairly straightforward to identify text that has been copied and pasted, and the data scientist in us would be very excited to code some form of regular expressions (regex) or clustering algorithm to help in detecting the notes required—but consider that this is “a step to a step” which could also take time and would need testing depending on your level of programming experience and exposure to the text. In my case, I was early in my HDS programming journey.\nI dedicated a period to run and test the first option, but noticed that there are notes that either get excluded or included which didn’t fit the study criteria. For example, if I filtered just by the category type (e.g. nursing progress note) and location (e.g. ICU), I ended up including notes from specialist nurses who visit ICU patients. Some of them may have a “Clinical Nurse Specialist” title in the system, others may have a “Registered Nurse” title. While some with the title “Registered Nurse” will do a progress note, not all of them will do a shift summary progress note for a patient. Some followed a specific format for writing shift summary notes, but others didn’t. It was definitely interesting for me to see the scenarios and variations of what happens in practice, and how these were reflected in the data!\nOverall, I had to find ways to match the notes and filter down to only what I needed—this was a great way to apply what I knew as a clinician, what I was learning in Python and practically working with Pandas and numpy! I decided not to skip the manual task of annotating the relevant notes and classifying whether they were done in ICU or not. This meant checking over a thousand notes individually, confirming that they were indeed shift summary notes, done by a nurse, and in ICU. Supervised machine learning could be an alternative to this, but for most machine learning tasks, having correctly labelled data or the “ground truth” would be ideal. While this step took considerable time, it was definitely worthwhile, as it has allowed me to understand our practice deeper and learn more about the nuances of clinical text.\n\n\n\nDanielle is a Clinician and Data Scientist with applied experience in the use of health data in clinical, research, and industry settings. (author supplied)\n\n\n\n\nStarting with simple and practical methods to answer a question and fit a defined context\nThere’s a plethora of methods, studies, and repos that can address a question/problem these days (and there’s chatGPT too!). As more and more sophisticated programs and analytical techniques have sprung up in recent years, it’s easy to get excited and carried away by the next shiny library/tool and lose sight of the core question being solved. For me, the true challenge for a data scientist lies in finding the right fit for the problem at hand.\nI read about different ways of calculating similarity—each had its own strengths, limitations, and implications. I tested and compared results across a few methods but found minimal differences in the results. After awhile I took a step back and reflected on the purpose and context of the study: from here, I settled on a method that might give results that are closer to the visual recognition of repetitive text, or mimic the feeling of “I think I’ve read that part!” among clinicians, as this relates more to the broader concerns of cognitive overload, efficiency, and value of text repetition in ICUs.\nAs it was an exploratory study, part of my goal was also to set a foundation that others may build on and contribute to the body of knowledge around the topic of electronic clinical documentation, especially for nurses. There’s lots of room for improving the study, but that in itself is part of the journey and the learning! This makes reflection on real-world findings, evidence-based recommendations, and learning different ways to tackle a question/problem possible.\nKnowing the problem/question, the purpose and context of the work, and resisting the urge to reinvent the wheel is also useful. Where there are existing methods and libraries, build on them and get creative. One may gain theoretical/academic brownie points as with increasing the complexity of a program/solution, but that may also mean that it’s less applicable, reproducible, or practical in a real world setting. Breaking down problems and simplifying solutions are superpowers, and one can build on these skills by reflecting on work and progress regularly.\n\n\nWorking with engaged leaders and supervisors and communicating with other teams to progress goals\nThe endless possibilities of programming may be exciting to us data scientists, but that wouldn’t always translate to another person. Communicating technical concepts to non-technical groups or individuals was perhaps one of the most challenging and rewarding parts of the project for me. This is something that I definitely picked up in the real world, and something that I sought out to do, as I wanted to use my clinical background and early HDS skills to bridge gaps across clinical, technical, and leadership teams.\nLearning to engage with key contacts from other departments is also important in the success of a project. For example, as I was preparing our ethics application, I sought advice from the research and ethics department and clarified points that we were unsure about. I learned a great deal about the process, and their team became acquainted with our project early on. It took a number of back and forth discussions with contacts but in the end, we saved considerable time as our application was approved on first submission. This would not have been possible without my supportive and empowering supervisor who was patient in listening to my ideas, and tremendously helpful in framing and consolidating them for applications and presentations. It’s always helpful to seek and receive feedback, particularly from experts who have already been through a similar process.\nAnother example demonstrating the importance of communication for the project was liaising with the medical records team. The initial dataset supplied to me was very large and didn’t look “right”. You’ll know this as you perform exploratory data analysis and find values that are either out of range or out of the context of your study. While I was excited that I’ve received the data (finally!), I knew I couldn’t use it for preparation and analysis yet, and had to have discussions with the person who extracted the data. Apart from going back to the data request form and project protocol, it was helpful for us to have meetings where we could walk through these together and quickly clarify questions. The extract took more time due to this, but in the end it worked out as the dataset was also halved and more aligned with the study requirements.\nOverall, working on a project based on a real world healthcare setting was a great way for me to apply my domain knowledge as a clinician while refining my skills as a data scientist. I enjoyed the highs and lows of the project—both on the technical and “soft” aspects as it exposed me to a variety of scenarios and unforeseen challenges, and encouraged me to become more adaptable, creative, and focused in my approaches. There are plenty of ideas and ideals we would like translated in the real world, but the cold hard truth is it isn’t as easy as “1,2,3” or “if A, then B.” The tools we have now and the bright promise of rapidly evolving techniques in data science will not be maximised if not applied to real world problems and data. I would highly encourage anyone to get involved and get their hands dirty with existing projects—apart from the opportunity to build on technical skills, it teaches a great deal of practical lessons about communication, project and time management, and collaboration which are all highly useful in driving projects forward, growing in your practice, having fun, and hopefully, making a difference!"
