We look at how health outcomes can be measured and reported in various forms of health data, and how these health data can reveal inequalities in health. The course describes the major sources of health data, including those relating to primary care, hospital stays and prescription medicines, and how this (and other) information can be used by the health data scientist to create evidence for policy and research.\nActivities are structured to foster a scientific, questioning attitude in the student. Students are encouraged to think critically about how health data are recorded, what this reveals about the underlying health delivery systems, and be creative in their use of health data sources to create or critically appraise evidence."

Obtaining actionable insights (or revealing the hidden signals) from such data requires the utilisation of probabilistic concepts. Thus a solid understanding of the principles of statistics is intrinsic to Health Data Science. The aim of this first course in probability theory is to introduce the foundations required to understand such phenomena.\nThe course design is highly innovative and novel. Statistical computing is used to gain a sound understanding of statistical theories and concepts. Specifically, this course draws on the practical application of Monte Carlo algorithms, which are a very effective method of statistical computing. Once this illustrative approach has (a posteriori) demonstrated a theory, it will then be stated formally.\nThe core content will be delivered through a flipped approach utilising audio-visual excerpts on the Moodle TELT platform, supported by presentations from Centre for Big Data Research in Health (CBDRH) experts. Statistical computing will be used as the process that drives the content. Peer instruction via discussion during face-to-face sessions will offer support in the form of collaborative learning. Active participation will be encouraged throughout, along with a reflective outlook."

Starting with linear regression, a major theme of the course is best practice in model fitting, including thorough exploratory data analysis, model assumption checking, data preparation and transformation, including the use of imputation, and careful attention to model adequacy and diagnostics. Emphasis is given to content-aware, purposive model building and the use of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of causal relations to inform model parameter selection. Non-linear, logistic, binomial and Poisson models for count data are also covered. Effect modifications (interactions) and their meaning in a health context are explored. The presentation and visualisation of statistical models is considered, with emphasis on the explanatory insights that can be gained from well-constructed models. The final part of the course covers basic time-series models, survival analysis and other time-to-event models."

Thus, the student is presented with the opportunity to bring all the content of the Graduate Diploma together, realising the relative ordering and merits of each stage. This capstone has the advantage of allowing a further 18 units of credit of broadening electives to be undertaken.\nThe capstone project involves completing extensive, desk-based, independent research tasks, requiring the use of the R and/or Python programming languages. An entire HDS project has been constructed and sliced into the respective stages of the HDS pipeline. At each stage, the student has the option of completing minor or major tasks to progress to the next stage. For example, at the ‘Curation’ stage, a minor task might be a short-written report (circa 1,000 words) identifying the issues to be addressed. A major task would involve preparation of a data management plan (DMP; circa 3,000 words). Each task will be assigned a point score based on its complexity, proportional to the expected (notional) time required to complete the task. To complete the course, will require successful completion of three minor and two major tasks.\nStudents are required to complete Graduate Diploma in Health Data Science (5372) to a satisfactory standing to be admitted onto this course."

At the time, there was limited information available on the logistics of delivering vaccinations at scale so in this study we used a special class of model—queue network models—to try to figure out the sweet spot between number of vaccinations per day, staffing levels and target processing times.\nI love this paper because it was addressing a very real and practical question. Before starting the I spent time at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital COVID Vaccination Clinic speaking to the health staff preparing and delivering vaccinations to better understand the process we were modelling. I also presented the completed work to the NSW Health Sydney Local Health District, as they prepared to set up their mass vaccination hub at Olympic Park.\nThe other thing I thought went well with this paper is the many ways we made the work accessible. To accompany the analysis we developed a shiny app that allows users to rerun our models, or to run alternative queuing models based on their own circumstances (number of staff, target daily vaccinations etc). As a companion to the academic paper, we also published an article in The Conversation to help share the lessons from our work as broadly as possible. Finally, all of the code from the analysis was made available on GitHub, following best practice for open science and reproducibility."

In particular, we trained and validated a gradient-boosted tree machine learning (ML) algorithm to forecast patient blood glucose and a 95% prediction interval at 2-hour intervals. Our forecasting model using routinely collected EMRs achieved performance comparable to previous models developed in planned research studies using continuous blood glucose monitoring. This paper demonstrates that EMRs can be used to train ML algorithms that may be suitable for incorporation into ICU decision support systems."

    "section": "",
    "text": "mamiya_adachi@yahoo.co.jp\n\n\n https://www.linkedin.com/in/mamiyaad/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManny Adachi is an aspiring data scientist from Japan in the Master’s program in Health Data Science. His interests are in motorcycle touring, traveling, and of course data science!!]\nThis is a short post about my participation in the SAS Cortex Analytics Simulation 5 Day Challenge (hereafter, Cortex) in April 2022. Luckily, I became the 1st place winner in the competition. It is not a direct application of what we have learned in the HDS program to the formal job scene. However, I think it can still provide you some idea of how much knowledge we can use outside the classes. Please also see the post by Lucia Biasi from SAS Australia for some details of the interview on me about my experience.\n\nWhat is Cortex?\nCortex is an analytics simulation game developed by SAS and HEC Montreal. It tests participants’ predictive modeling skills using a real-life problem as they compete against peers. The game scenario was to help a fictitious non-profit organization which needed to figure out who to contact from a list of potential donors. Using SAS Enterprise Miner, participants built a predictive model and generated a contact list to maximise the surplus amount (i.e. donation amount – cost of contacting). For the duration of Cortex, participants were allowed to revise the contact list up to around 30 times. The prior versions were also maintained in the system so participants are able to select their best contact list later on.\n\n\nWhat did I learn through Cortex?\nIt was my first and fun experience using a GUI (Graphic User Interface)-based tool to construct a pipeline of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and testing. The Cortex GUI allows users to interact with tools through icons, menus, and mouse. Therefore, it is more intuitive for the uses to have a control of the tool than entirely coding the required tasks. Although the tools we used in the school assignments such as Jupyter Notebook, R Studio, and SAS Studio have GUI components, with Cortex we could complete the tasks mostly without coding. It was, of course, way more convenient than mostly coding like we did for the school assignments. I could spend more time on thinking how to optimize the surplus amount (e.g., comparing the result using different base models and (hyper)parameters, how to minimize overfitting, deciding where to cut the list from the model (*cutting was done manually and still acceptable)).\n\n\n\nA pipeline diagram constructed on Cortex by Harry Ngo, a participant back in 2020. My final pipeline and final model were different from the above, but it should provide you a sufficient visualization of how things went\n\n\nSo, am I here just as a shill and say how brilliant the SAS platform was? No (although I know that I am already helping them…). Instead, I really want to emphasize that what ends up making the difference sometimes are something beyond knowing how to code a fancy and complex statistical or machine learning model. In my case during Cortex, what helped me were (1) the base knowledge from HDS about the characteristics of each machine learning model, (2) how to read the training / validation score graphs, (3) the strategy of submission time to minimize the other competitors’ time to revise their lists (i.e., submitting the best list when the game was approaching to the end and other competitors appeared satisfied with the moderate but not the best list), and (4) the persistency until the very last minute of the game.\nHere is a little more comment about (1). Although I cannot mention which model I used for my final contact list, I can say it helped me avoid overfitting my model and possibly bluff the other competitors with the list from the overfit model. It was one example of how we can apply our knowledge from HDS program to strategize our action.\n Learn more about the Cortex analytics simulation game at www.sas.com/cortex\n\n\nWinning the game, then what?\nAs the winner, I was offered the badge and 4-week internship at SAS Australia. During the internship I was able to (1) connect with SAS members in various teams such as technical support, pre / post-sales, delivery consulting, and customer success and learn about their roles and offerings, (2) access the study materials for SAS Viya programming associate exam for free, and (3) earn the certificate after passing the exam. Beside the time to connect with SAS members, I spent the majority of time studying for the exam, so it is indeed a large part of what I have learned through the internship. One thing I hoped to do was to practice how to integrate the models that we build with external sources such as Python or R. The integration is one of the key highlights on SAS Viya’s capability.\nI have to confess that I did not know much about the company and what they offer until several days after my internship started. (Please don’t blame me on this since obviously I got this internship opportunity without any interviews). In short, they offer the solutions which support the operations in the whole analytics life cycle, and they have been the long-established and leading vendor of the statistical data analysis software for various sectors such as government / public service, healthcare, banking / finance, and academia. You can also learn more about SAS from a post by Emmett Boudreau.\n\n\nConclusion\nI definitely recommend other students to participate in the Cortex competition hosted by SAS (or any hackathon events). It gives us not only the data science experience outside of class, but also the chance to have our hands on the analytics platforms used in the industry and connect with other participants and sometimes people from industry."

    "text": "How it started\nI embarked on the journey of completing my Masters in Health Data Science in late 2018. I had been mulling over the idea of post grad study for a while at that point but had not seen anything that really took my interest. I think I might have actually seen an add for this degree on Facebook and decided to take closer look. The appeal for me was the mix of data science with a clinical skew that would have application in my current work.\nI put in an application and was successful to start in the first term of 2019. At the time I was a full fee paying student (via HECS). I decided I would just do one subject per term to make sure I could manage the workload without impacting the rest of family too much."

    "text": "Managing Obstacles\n\nTime\nI was fortunate enough that I was able to negotiate flexible working hours which allowed me to work a full-time load over 4 days which left me the Friday every week to study. Thanks to the technological aspirations of the course, pretty much all the content was available online and there was only a few subject I missed the tutes for which I made up for by engaging online.\nWeek to week I would work through what I could during the evenings when I had free time and then finish things off on the Friday. Some weeks I would have the Friday free to attend to other duties because I already had experience in the course content for that week. Then I would generally spend extra time on the weekends to get on top of assignment deadlines.\nAt the start of each term I would map out the course deadlines on my calendar. I would make a plan for spending extra time on the assignments (I always used it). The week to week work was generally okay but if it was heavy and you got an assignment on top, it made it more difficult to keep on top. I always prioritised work that would give marks.\nI will say that my wife was amazing through the whole degree even though she definitely got frustrated at times. It can be difficult to balance the time commitments of study, work and family life. I would not recommend undertaking them without the full support of your significant other (if that is your situation).\n\n\n\nJason pictured with his family (author supplied)\n\n\n\n\nFamily\nIn 2020, we had a second child join us. We called him our COVID baby. This period was initially very agreeable to studying as pretty well everyone had to stay at home. I was considered frontline staff so still had to go to work but my wife was on maternity leave. All the course content was already online. It was just a case of continuing the practices I had started in 2019.\nIn 2021, restrictions were lifted and things started to open up more. My wife went back to work three days a week. Both kids were in day care four days a week. We still managed to work things so that both my wife and I had a day at home each without the kids. For me it was largely to study, for my wife it was to get a break and catch up on things.\n\n\nExpenses\nThe cost of a Masters can be prohibitive. I had a requirement through my employer to be working towards a higher degree so there was incentive to maintain studies based on that. However, after paying $3,500+ per subject we were beginning to feel the pinch. There were no Commonwealth Supported Places (CSP) when I had originally applied however, I had been keeping in touch with the Program Director (Sabita then Andrew) to see if there were any opportunities. Towards the end of 2020 the federal government had announced additional funding for STEM placements but I found out that they were only going to apply to new applicants. So at the end of 2020 I withdrew from my Masters and reapplied to commence in Term 1 2021. My gamble for securing a CSP paid off. My course fees went from around $4,000 to around $900!"

    "text": "Lessons\nAt the end of 2022, I completed my dissertation with a high distinction and had a weighted average mark of 90% for my entire Masters degree. To say I was chuffed would be an understatement.\nWriting out what I’ve been through for this blog makes it sound like it was actually a pretty straightforward thing to do. I haven’t gone into the depths of how we also moved house twice, sold a house, bought a house, changed the kids to different day care centres, plus managing all the routine day-to-day life things that get thrown at you. Not to mention work deadlines that come up as well! These are all the small things that suck up your time, often at critical moments because they are largely unplanned.\nWhat did I do to ensure that I was successful?\n\nMade sure my wife was on board\nGave myself a solid chunk of flexible time\nAttempted to use up other spare time before I got to my allocated time (if things were under control when I got to my allocated time then it could be used as free time or time for doing other things)\nNegotiated additional time requirements with my wife when needed (usually for assignments)\nPrioritised work that gave marks\n\nOne other thing that I think is important in a situation like this. If you aren’t in a position where you are relying on others to accomplish things then it doesn’t matter as much but I very much was. It was important to me that the time I was spending on study was not wasted. I felt a strong obligation to succeed in all the courses because I did not want the time I was taking away to be wasted."
