## What publication are you most proud of?

[Identifying preventable risk factors for hospitalised asthma in young Aboriginal children: a whole-population cohort study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2020-216189)[^1]. 
This was an analysis of a Western Australian linked dataset of Aboriginal kids and mums including hospital, emergency, mental health and sociodemographic data. It was a great opportunity to shine a light on pediatric asthma in a First Nations population and highlight the importance of reducing early respiratory infections and disadvantage.
