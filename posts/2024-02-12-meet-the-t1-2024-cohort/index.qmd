#### What attracted you to Health Data Science?
::: {.script}
I have always been interested in data. I‚Äôve been a marketer for more than 10 years and data and analytics are part of my job. I‚Äôve also been working with a Physiotherapy practice for more than 10 years and have come across a lot of health conditions so I thought it would be amazing to combine data and health together!

#### What attracted you to Health Data Science?
::: {.script}
My background is in health promotion so what attracts me to health data science are the endless opportunities to identify health disparities and design tailored interventions for a more equitable and accessible health system. I also love the art of data storytelling and seeing people have a-ha moments about really complex data once it is communicated through a beautiful visualisation.
